    "[1] A graph and a graph search algorithm are two different things, and the latter can be implemented generically over the former. This requires however the Graph (as well as the Node and Edge) class to implement a number of functions. While not a specifically daunting task, this is not within the scope of this exercise. We have therefore decided to keep the graph creation and search tighly coupled, allowing you (almost) complete freedom over the way nodes and edges are stored. For an example implementation of a generic graph library, the Boost Graph Library (BGL) is your best bet: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html"
