    "1. `graph.py`, which contains some class definitions and helper functions (*take a look at it when you start writing your algorithm*).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `grass_fire.py` contains an implementation of the Grass Fire algorithm, against the interface defined in the `graph.py` to give you an idea of how things work.\n",

    "3. `main.py` is used to manually (i.e. not in the notebook) run algorithms and visualize things.\n",

    "We have defined an abstract class for a path planning algorithm called `Graph`<sup>[1]</sup>, as well as an abstract class `Node`. Our `main` uses implementations of this interface to show the result of path planning (displaying the path and giving us its cost based on the algorithm's cost function). Your first task should be to take a look at the constructor and members of those two classes (you can ignore the helper function if you wish to).\n",

    "[1] A graph and a graph search algorithm are two different things, and the latter can be implemented generically over the former. This requires however the Graph (as well as the Node and Edge) class to implement a number of functions. While not a specifically daunting task, this is not within the scope of this exercise. We have therefore decided to keep the graph creation and search tighly coupled, allowing you (almost) complete freedom over the way nodes and edges are stored. For an example implementation of a generic graph library, the Boost Graph Library (BGL) is your best bet: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html\n",

You can still see the runtime information of the algorithm, but not the actual result, so try to get this running somehow :) if anyone knows of a nice alternative for rendering things in Jupyter, I *am* all ears.\n",

    "[3] the values for the maps I'm generating here should always work. Well, at least, according to a famous search engine, the numpy RNG (used here because the stdlib's is terribly slow) should be consistent accross platforms (Windows / OSX / Linux). Meaning we should both see the same map. If any of them does not work, fiddle a bit with the values until it does.\n",
